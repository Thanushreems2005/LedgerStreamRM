"""
LedgerStream shared V3 feature contract.

Single source of truth for the six V3 features the trained
HistGradientBoostingClassifier expects, in this exact order:

    [amount, hour, velocity, log_amount, is_night, amount_ratio]

There are two entry points:

* ``build_features_v3(df)``   - used at TRAIN time on the raw Kaggle
  DataFrame. `hour` is derived from the dataset's `Time` column
  (seconds-since-first-transaction), matching the validated audit exactly.

* ``build_feature_vector(event, history)`` - used at SERVE time on an
  incoming Kafka event. `hour` / `is_night` use the real UTC hour-of-day
  from the event timestamp (the same convention the shipped V1 model already
  uses); `velocity` and `amount_ratio` are recomputed from the account's
  timestamped 30-minute history in a way that matches training.

Both keep the SAME column order and the same time-window semantics for the
history-dependent features, so a cleanly loaded model is fed exactly the six
columns it was fitted on.
